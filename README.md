Dear recruiter/hiring manager, please see this folder to understand my coding ability in the **Python** and **JavaScript** programming languages. 

The work recorded is from '**Codewars**,' a platform that allows individuals to practice their programming. It is similar to LeetCode, but different in the culture and theme of assessing skills. 

Most of my completed challenges range from **'8 kyu - 6 kyu'**. 8 kyu is the least challenging and 1 kyu is the hardest. This displays my ability to understand the basics such as** syntax, documentation, and efficiency** in problem-solving through code.

Should you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me through LinkedIn or my email: steevensangou@gmail.com.
