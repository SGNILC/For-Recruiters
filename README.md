Dear recruiter/hiring manager, please see this folder to learn about my coding abilities in the Python and JavaScript programming languages. 

The work recorded is from Codewars, a platform that allows individuals to practice programming. It is similar to LeetCode but different in its culture and theme of assessing skills. Please see the folder, "problems_and_solutions," which documents my code and solutions.

Should you have any further questions, please contact me through LinkedIn or my email: steevensangou@gmail.com.
